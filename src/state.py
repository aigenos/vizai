"""Cross-day dedup state: remember what previous digests already covered.

A lightweight JSON file (``<archive_dir>/.state/seen_items.json``) maps
URL/title hashes to the unix timestamp they were first covered, so an item
featured yesterday is dropped from today's candidate set. The workflow already
commits ``docs/`` back to the repo, so persistence is free.

FAIL-OPEN by design: a missing or corrupt state file means "nothing seen yet"
and a failed save is a warning — cross-day dedup must never kill the run.
