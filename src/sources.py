"""Source registry.

Two kinds of sources:

1. RSS/Atom feeds we fetch deterministically (structured, dated entries).
2. "Web targets" we don't have a reliable feed for — these are handed to the
   provider's web_search tool so it can pull the latest items itself.

RSS URLs change over time; a broken feed is skipped gracefully at fetch time and
the web-search layer is expected to backfill the gap.

FIELD PRESETS: set ``SOURCE_PRESET`` (e.g. ``security``, ``biotech``,
``fintech``) to swap the whole source pack for another field — see
``src/presets/``. The default (``ai``) is exactly the lists defined below.
